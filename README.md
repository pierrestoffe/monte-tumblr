Monte
======

Monte is a responsive Tumblr theme for photographers looking for a dead-simple way to efficiently showcase their best shots. A Wordpress version is also available in [the repo next door](https://github.com/pierrestoffe/monte-wordpress).

## Demonstration

Nothing better than a demonstration to understand how simple Monte is, so [please visit this test page](http://monte-theme.tumblr.com). All photographs were kindly provided by 
[Allie & David](http://deathtothestockphoto.com).

## Features

- Responsive (smartphone, tablet and desktop)
- Dead-simple
- Automatic images slider
- Navigation by click, touch swipe or keyboard direction keys
- Free of charge

## Installation

Due to the lack of support for text, quote, link, chat, audio and video post types in Monte, I can't submit it to the [Tumblr Theme Garden](http://www.tumblr.com/themes/). It means you'll have to add this theme to your website by hand.

You've never installed a theme on Tumblr? Don't worry, it's easy as pie... and really fast!

#### What you'll need

Unlike Wordpress, Tumblr only requires a single template file to work its magic. The code for this template sits in the index.html file, so just open it in your favourite code editor (or TextEdit/Notepad).

You'll also need to go to this page http://www.tumblr.com/customize/your-blog-shortname (replace 'your-blog-shortname' by your blog shortname of course) and click the 'Edit HTML' button, right under the screenshot of your current theme to display the Tumblr code editor.

#### Transfer the code

Now the most delicate part, be ready!
Copy all the code from the index.html file and paste it into the Tumblr code editor. 

Oh yes, that's it, already...

#### Time to say goodbye

Don't forget to save everything, reload the page and fill in the variables in the Customize page (http://www.tumblr.com/customize/your-blog-shortname).

## Customization

#### Personal information

Once installed, you'll be able to add your personal information: your name, your job title, your address, phone and email.

#### Fonts

Not happy with the default font? You've got two choices here:

- You've got a [Typekit](https://typekit.com/fonts) subscription? Then you need to insert the 7-digit code relative to your kit into the 'Typekit code' field and set the font shortname (eg. proxima-nova) into the 'Typekit font' field.

- You're looking for a free solution? Then you just need to type the exact name of the [Google Web Font](http://www.google.com/fonts) you want into the 'Google Web Fonts' field (for example, PT Sans or Open Sans or Gudea) and the font code (same as the previous field but with spaces replaced by a +) into the 'Google Web Fonts short' field (for example, PT+Sans or Open+Sans or Gudea).

Be sure to leave the unneeded fields empty.

#### Google Analytics

Interested in knowing who visits your website? Then you've probably already set up a [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics/web/) account. To make it work with Monte, you'll just need to insert your personal code into the 'Google Analytics ID' field.

## How to use

Just add a new image post containing only one photograph, no description or anything, then publish it.

That's it.
