- Free of charge

## Installation

Just head over the [Tumblr theme gallery]() and add Monte to your Tumblr website.

## How to use

Just add a new image post with only one image, no description or anything, then publish it. That's it.

## Customization

#### Personal information

Once installed, you'll be able to add your personnal information: your name, your job title, your address, phone and email.

#### Fonts

You've got two choices here:

- You've got a [Typekit](https://typekit.com/fonts) subscription? Then you need to insert the 7-digit code relative to your new Kit into the 'Typekit code' field and set the font shortname into the 'Typekit font' field.

- You're looking for a free solution? Then you just need to type the exact name of the [Google Web Font](http://www.google.com/fonts) you want into the 'Google Web Fonts' field (for example, PT Sans or Open Sans or Gudea) and the font code (same as the previous field but with spaces replaced by a +) into the 'Google Web Fonts short' field (for example, PT+Sans or Open+Sans or Gudea).

#### Google Analytics

Interested in knowing who visits your website? Then you've probably already set up a [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics/web/) account. To make it work with Monte, you'll just need to insert your personnal code into the 'Google Analytics' field.

#### Any other ideas

If you like CSS and have ideas to improve Monte, feel free to add your own custom CSS.
