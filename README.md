Monte
======

Monte is a responsive Tumblr theme for photographers looking for a dead-simple way to efficiently showcase their best shots.

## Demonstration

Nothing better than a demonstration to understand how simple Monte is, so [please visit this test page](http://monte-theme.tumblr.com). All photographs were kindly provided by

## Installation

Just head over the [Tumblr theme gallery]() and add Monte to your Tumblr website.

## Customization

#### Personal information

Once installed, you'll be able to add your personnal information: your name, your job title, your address, phone and email.

#### Fonts

You've got two choices here:

- You've got a [Typekit](https://typekit.com/fonts) subscription? Then you need to insert the 7-digit code relative to your new Kit into the 'Typekit code' field and set the font shortname into the 'Typekit font' field.
- You're looking for a free solution? Then you just need to type the exact name of the [Google Web Font](http://www.google.com/fonts) you want (occasionnal spaces replaced by a +) into the 'Google Web Fonts' field (for example, PT+Sans or Open+Sans or Gudea).

#### Google Analytics

Interested in knowing who visits your website? Then you've probably already set up a [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics/web/) account. To make it work with Monte, you'll just need to insert your personnal code into the 'Google Analytics' field.

#### Any other ideas

If you like CSS and have ideas to improve Monte, feel free to add your own custom CSS. And don't hesitate to fork this repo.
