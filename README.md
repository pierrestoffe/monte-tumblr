## Installation

You've never installed a theme on Tumblr? Don't worry, it's quite easy... and really fast!

#### What you'll need

Unlike Wordpress, Tumblr only requires a single template file to work its magic. In this case, it's the index.html file. Everything you'll need is in it, so just open it in your favourite code editor.

You'll also need to go to this page: http://www.tumblr.com/customize/your-blog-shortname (replace 'your-blog-shortname' by your blog shortname of course) and click the 'Edit HTML' button, right under the screenshot of your current theme.

#### Transfer the code

Now the most delicate part, be ready!
Copy all the code from the index.html file and paste it into the Tumblr code editor. 

Oh yes, that's it, already...

#### Time to say goodbye

Don't forget to save everything, to reload the page and fill in the variables in the Customize page (http://www.tumblr.com/customize/your-blog-shortname) and you're already good to go.
